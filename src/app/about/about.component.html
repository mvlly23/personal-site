              I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a BS in Computer Science in 2021, however, my passion for Computer Science started years before!
              I first started learning programming in my high schools FIRST Robotics team! After realizing my passion for computer science, I went to South Carolina to study! While there,
              had the opportunity to gain experience in Java whilst helping TA students in a lab environment. I would start to learn full stack web development later on while interning at Boeing.
              While there, I used react and Kotlin Spring to develop an internal site, while also creating a CI/CD pipeline for Blue/Green deployments, testing, and more! Finally I worked with University of South Carolina's AI Institute before graduating.
              I had the opportunity to work on a project helping those who suffer from sickle cell aneomia. Specifically, I used Python on AWS Lambda to injest data from Withings API.

              After graduating, I worked at Infrasight Software Corp. as an associate software engineer. While there, I mainly worked on their REST API written in Java utilizing the micronaut framework.
              This also provided the opportunity to work with MongoDB. My favorite part of that job, however, was working in C++ on their metrics collector, and creating a license manager! The license manager utilized CryptoPP to create secure RSA-based licenses to access their metrics collector.
              Eventually, I would come to manage new developer onboarding and create training materials!

              After my time at Infrasight, I started working at Spectrum as a Software Engineer. At Spectrum, I've been working with Typescript (Angular) and Python to help develop a leading advertisement campaign generator.
              This has led me to work on a plethora of problems, from rewriting an API to work with a new integration platform, creating a service to help manage geo-data for a mapbox service, helping with data integrations, working with Snowflake, creating polling services, and more!
              The geo project specifically also gave me experience with setting up infrastructure using AWS CloudFormation and serverless.

            My interests outside of development are mainly Philosophy and Filmography. I am currently tring to self-produce a documentary, <a href="/videography">New Left Dropouts</a>, please check that page for information and updates!
