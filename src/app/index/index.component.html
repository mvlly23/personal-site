<h3>Body Without Organs</h3>
<p>I've also recently had a large interest in post-structuralism, mainly, the work of Deleuze and Guatarri. I thought it would be interesting to build a small demo in Godot explaining Deleuze and Guatarri's concept of the Body without Organs. They formulated this idea in 'Anti-Oedipus' and expanded on it in 'A Thousand Plateaus'. To play, please click 'Start' below!</p> -->
